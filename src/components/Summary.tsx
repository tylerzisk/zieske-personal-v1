  <p>
    I&#39;m an innovative software developer with a strong track record of
    leading Agile teams, mentoring developers, and implementing efficient CI/CD
    pipelines. I specialize in building scalable, event-driven systems using
    technologies like TypeScript, NodeJS, Spring Boot, and AWS Lambda. My work
    consistently focuses on delivering high-quality features, improving
    developer workflows, and ensuring smooth, reliable deployments. Over the
    years, I&#39;ve contributed to impactful projects across industriesâ€”from
    modernizing Homeland Security&#39;s I-9 verification systems to building
    data-driven features at cybersecurity and market research firms. I thrive in
    collaborative environments where I can share best practices, guide newer
    developers, and drive continuous improvement across the codebase. Whether
    it&#39;s standing up microservices, designing GraphQL APIs, or optimizing
    ETL workflows, I bring a detail-oriented, client-focused mindset to every
    project.
